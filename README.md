## Abstract

&emsp;&emsp; Coral reefs around the world are progressivley becoming under threat from climate change, and a warming ocean. As a result, mass bleaching events are killing coral communities at an unprecented rate, which necessitates a better understanding of how these corals metabolically respond to this stressful event. This exploratory research aims to use protein and lipid data to uncover any hidden patterns in coral metabolism during both stressful and homeostatic conditions using a suite of analytical packages in R.
